# InteractiveGlobe-using-OpenGL
Env : Windows 10, Visual Studio 2019, C++, OpenGL 3.3, GLFW, GLAD, std



This project show you an interactive 3D globe or 2D projection map.

For that, I used Plate-Carree projection which is also called equirectangular projection.

Actually I was wondering which one is the best projection because every projection has distortion.

The major purpose of this project is a beautiful interactive world for further interactive mobile applications.

Especially, Plate-Caree and Pattern-Cylindrical projection were important comparisons.
